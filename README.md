  ## Description

  My motivation for this project was to shorten time for myself and other developers when creating a professional README for projects. 

  I created this to help show the importance of a README which is often times overlooked. README's are super important and information should be given the same time and attention that is given to your project! I hope this makes it easier for developers to use this project, with a single command line will guide you along the way and display your professionally personalized README. 

  This project helped me learn a lot! It helped me learn the basics of node and learned how to include libraries in my script files. I learned about inquirer which helped me explore the terminal and gathering user input and be able to paste their responses on a generated page. This was an awesome project that I will use often for every project! 

  Here is a video link & a qr code that will bring you to the video that will give you a brief walkthrough of my application, hope you enjoy thank you!
